# HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING JAVA AWT AND SWING

## **ABSTRACT**

The hospital management system maintains a collection of databases of various data like patient history, the details of the patients and doctors, regarding the status of available doctors, virtual pharmacy etc., and the primary aim of the project is to record all details of the doctor- patient diagnosis and treatment and store the data. Each user is given a unique id for the reference purpose, and there is even a provision for the allotment of rooms based on the intensity of severity of the illness, suffered by the patient.
		Moreover, there is also a facility for providing the data pertaining to the details of the doctor and the corresponding patient. For this purpose, a unique id along with a password is provided. The details of the patient and the doctor can be accessed by the admin. Also, the doctor can access a patient’s medical history. And, the patients can access the information of the available doctors.
		This project offers a method to make the process of the hospital management system easy and available at any time. It is user- friendly and overcomes the complex difficulty faced by the manual mode of data storage, and provides a simple method that can be understood by all.
